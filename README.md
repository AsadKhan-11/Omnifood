# Omnifood
Omnifood is a web page about about meals. 
First of all we will divide all the requirements into sections to make it easier.
1) We will make the hero page that will contain the nav-bar with the logo, the name of the brand, and some pictures that the brand has to offer to make it look good.
2) Secondly, we will make a section of how it works. In this we will guide the viewers on how they can have the things that they like from us.
3) The next section will be about the meals. This tells the customers what we are offering them.
4) Then comes the most important part, the Testimonials. The testimonials develop a sense of trust in the people's mind. So you need feedbacks from your customers that will make others to choose you. We can also add pictures beside it to make it look mre exquisite.
5) Next you can add the pricing of your meal plans and also add some icons.
6) In the end just make a form from where the people can add their information .
7) The footer is also an essential part.


# Key components 
1) We will set the font size to 62.5% so that 1 rem = 10px.
2) On hovering the meal card we'll use => transform: translateY(-1.2rem) with a shadow;
3) To make the images zoom within the div =>  transform: scale(1.1) and also apply transition;
4) To apply the gradient int the form => background-image: linear-gradient(
      to right bottom,
      rgba(235, 151, 78, 0.35),
      rgba(231, 125, 34, 0.356)
    )
